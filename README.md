# Hoppy Hare
## High School J-Term Project

My name is Matthew Mehrtens and I'm a 15-year old developer. This app was developed for a week-long J-Term project at my high school.

The game is based off of Flappy Bird with just a bit more flair to it. Once it's released, feel free to download it off the appstore and give it a go!
